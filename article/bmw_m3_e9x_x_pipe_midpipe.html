          The BMW M3 E9X X-Pipe Midpipe is designed to fit the following models:

        <h2>Features of the BMW M3 E9X X-Pipe Midpipe</h2>
        <p>
          The BMW M3 E9X X-Pipe Midpipe is a high-performance exhaust system
          that is designed to enhance the car's exhaust note and performance.
          The midpipe is made from high-quality stainless steel, which makes it
          durable and resistant to corrosion. The X-pipe design ensures smooth
          airflow and reduces backpressure, resulting in improved horsepower and
          torque.
        </p>
        <p>
          The BMW M3 E9X X-Pipe Midpipe also features a resonator delete, which
          further enhances the car's exhaust note. The resonator delete removes
          the factory resonator, which is designed to reduce exhaust noise. With
          the resonator delete, the car produces a more aggressive exhaust note,
          which is perfect for car enthusiasts who want a more sporty sound.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, the resonator delete enhances the car's exhaust note, making

          replacement for the stock midpipe, meaning that no modifications are
          required for installation. However, it is recommended that the
