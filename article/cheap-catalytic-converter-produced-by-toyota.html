        <h2>Addressing Challenges in Catalytic Converter Production</h2>

        <p>
          The increased use of catalytic precious metals for exhaust gas cleanup
          and air pollution reduction presents numerous challenges, including
          escalated costs and resource depletion. Toyota has undertaken
          extensive research and development to address these issues, focusing
          on enhancing the purification efficiency of catalytic precious metals.
          This includes optimizing substrate shape and length, as well as
          adjusting cell wall thickness and cross-sectional area. Other R&D
          endeavors involve selectively washcoating precious metals and
          catalytic materials, along with modifying catalytic substrate cell
          density to align with exhaust gas flows.
        </p>

        <h2>Collaborative Development with Denso Corporation</h2>

        <p>
          Toyota and Denso Corporation collaborated to develop the new FLAD®
          substrate to enhance the uniformity of exhaust gas flow. Through
          rigorous validations using simulations and prototype substrates, both
          companies succeeded in improving the exhaust gas flow uniformity
          within the catalyst. This was achieved by optimizing factors such as
          the ratios of cross-sectional areas of cells at the inner and outer
          portions and their corresponding densities. Consequently, with this
          advancement, approximately 20 percent less precious metal is utilized
          in a more compact catalyst that occupies roughly 20 percent less
          volume, while maintaining equivalent exhaust gas purification
          performance to conventional catalysts. Moreover, the newly developed
          innovative design and manufacturing technologies have enabled the mass
          production of the world’s first integrally molded catalyst.
        </p>

        <h2>Comparative Catalyst Structures</h2>

        <h3>Catalyst Structure</h3>

        <h4>Conventional Catalyst</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Uniform cross-sectional area of each cell (uniform channels for
            exhaust gas)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="container-16x9">
          <img
            class="responsive-iframe"
            src="/assets/images/expensive-catalytic-converter-flowrate.webp"
            alt="expensive catalytic converter flowrate"
            loading="lazy"
          />
        </div>

        <h4>New Catalyst</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Smaller cross-sectional area of cells at the inner portion (narrower
            channels for exhaust gas), with higher cell density
          </li>
          <li>
            Larger cross-sectional area of cells at the outer portion (wider
            channels for exhaust gas), with lower cell density
          </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="container-16x9">
          <img
            class="responsive-iframe"
            src="/assets/images/cheap-catalytic-converter-flowrate.webp"

            loading="lazy"
          />
        </div>

        <h2>Understanding Catalytic Converter Functionality</h2>

        <p>
          Currently, the most widely used substrate in exhaust gas purifying
          catalysts for gasoline engines is ceramic (cordierite), featuring a
          honeycomb structure composed of square or hexagonal cells. These
          cells' walls are washcoated with catalytic materials such as platinum
          (Pt), rhodium (Rh), palladium (Pd), and other precious metals,
          providing a catalytic effect to purify harmful gases like carbon
          monoxide (CO), unburned hydrocarbons (HC), and nitrogen oxide (NOx)
          within the exhaust, making it safer.
        </p>

        <h2>Optimizing Exhaust Gas Flow</h2>

        <p>
          While conventional catalysts have a uniform cell cross-sectional area,
          the newly developed FLAD® substrate features a structure with
          different cell cross-sectional areas between the inner and outer
          portions. Toyota has successfully achieved mass production of this
          substrate using the world’s first design and manufacturing technology
          capable of integrally molding the catalyst.
        </p>

        <h2>Balancing Exhaust Gas Flow</h2>

        <h3>Flow of exhaust gas within the catalyst</h3>

        <h4>Conventional Catalyst</h4>
        <p>Exhaust gas flow concentrated at the inner portion</p>

        <h4>New Catalyst</h4>
        <p>
          Improved uniformity of exhaust gas flow through different cell
          cross-sectional areas in the inner and outer portions
        </p>

        <p>
          Uniform exhaust gas flow within catalysts installed in exhaust pipes
          enables the effective purification of exhaust gas by the washcoated
          precious metals and other catalytic materials. However, the use of
          conventional substrates with uniform cell cross-sectional areas
          results in an imbalanced flow of exhaust gas because the gas flow
          through the inner portion of the catalyst is faster and at a higher
          volume than that through the outer portion. Consequently, more
          catalytic precious metal is required at the inner portion of the
          catalyst to maintain purification performance. Current catalytic
          material washcoating technologies require all cell walls to be coated
          equally during the washcoating process, resulting in parts of the
          catalyst with a lower exhaust gas flow rate being coated with the same
          amount of catalytic precious metals as those parts with a higher flow
          rate.
