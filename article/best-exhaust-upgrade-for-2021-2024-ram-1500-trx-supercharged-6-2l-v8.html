          The MagnaFlow Ram TRX xMOD <a href="https://exhaust.contact/article/cat-back-vs-axle-back-exhaust-systems-a-comprehensive-comparison.html">Cat-Back</a> Performance Exhaust System #19552
          is designed to enhance the performance and sound of your 2021-2024 Ram
          1500 TRX. Known for its versatility, this exhaust system provides a
          configurable exhaust sound that can be tailored to your preferences.
          Each #19552 kit incorporates MagnaFlow’s No Drone Technology (NDT) to
          minimize unwanted noise at lower RPMs while delivering a deep,
          signature exhaust tone in any configuration.
        </p>
        <p>
          A key feature of the NDT is the swappable NDT Delete module, which
          uses ¼-wave passive noise cancellation to ensure quiet highway driving
          while allowing for a robust sound under acceleration. The kit also
          includes two additional interchangeable xMOD modules: the xTreme
          Deletes and Muffler Modules. The xTreme Deletes module offers a
          straight pipe, unmuffled exhaust sound for a bold, aggressive tone,
          while the Muffler Modules provide a deep and powerful, yet more
          subdued sound, utilizing MagnaFlow’s straight-through muffler design.
        </p>
        <p>
          These modules are engineered for dyno-proven performance and can be
          easily swapped thanks to racing-bred v-band clamps. The #19552 exhaust
          system features mandrel bent 3” tubing with a dual exit configuration
          and black double-wall powder-coated 5” tips. It is constructed with
          100% stainless steel using CNC precision robotic manufacturing and is
          backed by MagnaFlow’s limited lifetime warranty. Ensure compliance
          with local noise regulations.
