          Universal Valved Muffler - Tuning the Sound and Performance of Your Car
        </h1>
        <p>
          The muffler is an essential component of a car's exhaust system,
          responsible for reducing engine noise and influencing the car's
          performance (torque, power). However, not all mufflers are created equal.
          Check out the universal valved muffler, which has gained popularity due to
          its unique features and advantages.
        </p>
        <h2>What is a universal valved muffler and how does it work?</h2>
        <p>
          The universal valved muffler, also known as a valved exhaust, is a set
          consisting of a muffler, a valve, and the necessary components for remote
          valve control. The whole and is designed in such a way as to provide 2
          variants of flue gas flow to choose from.Valve can be opened or closed
          using a remote control, allowing the driver to control the exhaust noise
          level according to their preferences. When the valve is closed, the
          exhaust gases are directed into a second pipe of smaller diameter, which
          connects to a multifunctional expansion chamber within the muffler. This
          reduces the exhaust volume and changes its sound. The expanded gases slow
          down in the chamber, further contributing to noise reduction. From the
          chamber, the exhaust gases pass through perforations into the main pipe.
          Opening the valve enables a free flow of gases through a straight pipe
          within the muffler, equipped with sections of holes. This results in a
          louder exhaust sound and reduces backpressure, which is not beneficial,
          especially at high engine speeds.
        </p>

        <h2>Benefits of using such a solution in the exhaust system</h2>
        <p>
          The main advantage of this solution is the ability to adjust the car's
          exhaust sound while driving. Using the included remote control, car
          enthusiasts can open and close the valve, adjusting the exhaust volume to
          achieve either an aggressive or subtle tone that suits their style and
          preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, the universal valved muffler can improve the vehicle's
          performance. When the valve is open, it enhances the exhaust gas
          scavenging process. This can have a positive impact on the power and
          torque curve, especially noticeable in high-performance vehicles. If a
          stock car has undergone chip-tuning or other modifications aimed at
          improving performance but without modifying the exhaust, the stock exhaust
          system might limit the additional potential or cause the engine to
          overheat. In such cases, a less restrictive exhaust system with one or
          several valve mufflers can be built.
        </p>
        <p>
          The muffler is made of polished stainless steel, making it more resistant
          to atmospheric conditions and the harsh environment found in exhaust
          systems. The particularly high temperature in the exhaust system does not
          impress it much compared to a muffler made of black aluminized steel. Its
          durability and aesthetic appearance are distinguishing features.
        </p>
        <h2>Installation and compatibility of the kit</h2>
        <p>
          The kit is designed to fit a wide range of vehicles, making it a popular
          choice for car enthusiasts. However, ensuring compatibility with the car's
          exhaust system is crucial. Therefore, various inlet and outlet pipe
          diameters are available to match the muffler to the existing exhaust
          system:
        </p>
        <p>63mm / 2.5 Inch</p>
        <p>76mm / 3 Inch</p>
        <p>89mm / 3.5 Inch</p>
        <p>101mm / 4 Inch</p>
        <p>
          Installation can be done by a professional mechanic or a skilled DIY
          enthusiast. After selecting the appropriate pipe diameter, the muffler can
          be welded or connected to the exhaust system using additional screw-on
          connectors, reducers, or elbows. The kit also includes two remote controls
          for opening and closing the valve, a vacuum module receiving signals from
          the remote control, and hoses for connecting and controlling the vacuum
          valve. The supplied power cable is equipped with a plug that can be
          connected to the cigarette lighter socket.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          If you want to customize the sound of your car's exhaust or improve its
          performance even while driving, consider a universal valved muffler. With
          the ability to control the sound level and reduce backpressure, this
          muffler provides a unique driving experience. Just remember to choose the
          appropriate pipe diameters to match your existing exhaust system or for
          any planned modifications.
