        <h1>Subaru BRZ or Scion FR-S (Toyota GT86) Valved Cat Back Exhaust</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Are you looking to upgrade your Subaru BRZ, Scion FR-S, or Toyota
          GT86? A valved cat back exhaust system is an excellent choice for
          those looking to improve performance and sound. This type of exhaust
          system can provide several benefits, including increased horsepower
          and torque, improved sound, and a reduction in weight. In this
          article, we will explore the advantages of a valved cat back exhaust
          system and why you should consider one for your Subaru BRZ or Scion
          FR-S (Toyota GT86).
        </p>
        <h2>Advantages of a Valved Cat Back Exhaust System</h2>
        <h3>Increased Performance</h3>
        <p>
          A valved cat back exhaust system can provide significant improvements
          in the performance of your Subaru BRZ or Scion FR-S (Toyota GT86). By
          reducing exhaust system backpressure, a catback exhaust can increase
          horsepower and torque. This increase in power can be even more
          significant if you pair it with other performance upgrades, such as an
          intake or tune. The valved feature allows for the exhaust sound to be
          controlled, allowing for a quieter exhaust note when needed.
        </p>
        <h3>Improved Sound</h3>
        <p>
          The sound of your car is an essential part of the driving experience.
          A valved cat back exhaust system can significantly enhance the sound
          of your Subaru BRZ or Scion FR-S (Toyota GT86). This type of exhaust
          system provides a deeper, more aggressive exhaust note, giving your
          car a sporty and powerful sound. The valved feature also allows for
          the exhaust sound to be controlled, allowing for a quieter exhaust
          note when needed. The improved exhaust sound can make your driving
          experience more enjoyable, and the aggressive tone can turn heads
          wherever you go.
        </p>
        <h3>Reduced Weight</h3>
        <p>
          One of the benefits of a valved cat back exhaust system is the
          reduction in weight. This type of exhaust system is available in both
          stainless steel and titanium construction, with titanium being the
          lighter option. With less weight, the Subaru BRZ or Scion FR-S (Toyota
          GT86) can accelerate faster, handle better, and be more
          fuel-efficient. Additionally, the reduced weight can help to improve
          the longevity of other components in the vehicle, such as the brakes
          and suspension.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
