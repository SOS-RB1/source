        <h1>Fake exhaust tips convert to real in Audi SQ5</h1>

        <p>
          The Audi SQ5 is an undeniably stylish and capable SUV, but there’s one
          design choice that has frustrated owners since the B9 generation
          debuted: fake exhaust tips. Instead of being functional, the shiny
          oval outlets integrated into the rear bumper are purely cosmetic. The
          real exhaust pipes actually point downward and remain hidden
          underneath. Fortunately, many owners have found ways to convert these
          fake tips into real ones—achieving both visual satisfaction and a
          deeper, sportier sound.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this article, we’ll explore what SQ5 owners have learned about this
          popular modification, what to watch out for during the process, and
          where you can buy the official Audi Sport exhaust tips (part number
          80A-071-904) to do the same.

        <h2>Why did Audi use fake exhaust tips?</h2>
        <p>
          Audi isn’t alone in choosing fake exhaust tips; many premium brands do
          this to keep the rear bumper design clean, reduce heat exposure, and
          meet emissions standards. However, many SQ5 owners feel that real,
          functional exhaust tips offer more authenticity and aesthetic appeal,
          making the extra effort and cost to retrofit worthwhile.
        </p>

        <h2>The most popular solution: OEM Audi Sport tips</h2>
        <p>
          Many owners choose to upgrade to the OEM Audi Sport exhaust tips (part
          number 80A-071-904). These aren’t just hollow covers—they feature
          perforations and internal chambers that slightly deepen the exhaust
          note, adding a richer sound without becoming too loud.
        </p>

        <p>They can be found directly on eBay:</p>

        <p>
          While prices can range from around $1,200 to $2,500 depending on
          location and finish, many owners believe the quality, sound
          improvement, and OEM fit make them worth it.
        </p>

        <h2>What owners discovered during installation</h2>
        <p>
          Owners who attempted this modification themselves often share that it
          can be more involved than it seems. For some, it took several hours of
          careful work, using tools like a drill, mini saw, Dremel, and file to
          cut precise openings in the rear valance. The rear bumper plastic
          doesn’t have clear guide lines, so patience and careful measuring are
          essential to achieve a neat look.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another common challenge is that the driver-side exhaust tip can
          appear slightly angled or uneven because the factory muffler exit on
          that side points upward. This design helps reduce condensation but can
          complicate installation. Some owners managed to correct this by slowly
          bending the pipe downward using tools like vice grips, adjusting in
          small increments until level.
        </p>

        <p>
          A key lesson repeated among SQ5 enthusiasts is to avoid rushing or
          taking the car to a standard exhaust shop that may prioritize speed
          over precision. A quick install might result in crooked tips, rough
          cuts, or uneven gaps that can be noticeable—especially to other
          enthusiasts.
        </p>

        <h2>Do the tips really change the sound?</h2>
        <p>
          Surprisingly, yes. The OEM Audi Sport tips act like mini resonators
          thanks to their perforations and internal chambers. Owners describe
          the resulting sound as deeper, more refined, and slightly louder than
          stock. While it won’t transform the car into something dramatically
          louder, the subtle improvement is noticeable and appreciated by many.
        </p>

        <p>
          For enthusiasts, this change adds just enough character to the exhaust
          note to make the upgrade feel worthwhile, without becoming overly
          aggressive.
        </p>

        <h2>Fitment details and model years</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most important details to check before starting is which
          model year you have. The 80A-071-904 tips were officially designed for
          the B9.5 facelift SQ5 (2021+). These models already have rear bumpers
          with openings to accommodate the real exhaust tips.
        </p>

        <p>
          Owners with earlier B9 models (2018–2020) often find that the tips
          don’t line up correctly without modification. Common solutions
          include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cutting or trimming the existing rear valance,</li>
          <li>
            Replacing the lower bumper cover with the facelift version (though
            this usually isn’t a direct fit),
          </li>
          <li>
            Or having a custom exhaust shop fabricate extensions and adjust the
            muffler exits.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Checking the part compatibility for your exact model year before
          purchase is essential to avoid surprises.
        </p>

        <h2>Alternative approaches</h2>
        <p>
          Not everyone wants to pay the premium price for OEM parts. Some owners
          have chosen alternative solutions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Purchasing less expensive aftermarket tips and having them welded
            and adjusted by a custom exhaust shop,
          </li>
          <li>Custom fabricating pipes to route the exhaust to new tips,</li>
          <li>
            Or powder-coating the tips for a unique blacked-out appearance.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Each option has trade-offs in terms of cost, fitment, and final
          appearance, so it comes down to personal preference and budget.
        </p>

        <h2>Is it worth it?</h2>
        <p>
          For most owners who completed the project, the answer is yes. The
          benefits often mentioned include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Replacing the fake, decorative look with functional exhaust tips,
          </li>
          <li>Adding a deeper and slightly louder exhaust note,</li>
          <li>And improving resale appeal to fellow enthusiasts.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Although the parts are expensive and installation can be
          time-consuming, many say the satisfaction of seeing real exhaust
          tips—and hearing the subtle improvement in sound—justifies the effort.
        </p>

        <h2>Final advice before starting</h2>
        <p>
          If you’re planning to convert your fake exhaust tips to real on an
          Audi SQ5:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Confirm your exact model year to ensure fitment,</li>
          <li>
            Budget for both the tips and professional installation if needed—or
            set aside time for careful DIY work,
          </li>
          <li>
            Be prepared to modify the valance if your car is an earlier model,
          </li>
          <li>
            And choose OEM parts when possible for the best appearance and fit.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Ready to begin? The OEM Audi Sport exhaust tips (part number
          80A-071-904) can easily be found online — and they’re what most owners
          recommend for the best look and sound.
        </p>

        <p>
          For many, this project transforms the rear of the SQ5 from “fake” to
          truly authentic — and that change makes all the difference.
