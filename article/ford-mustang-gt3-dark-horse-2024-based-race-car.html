          Ford Mustang Enters FIA GT3 Category with New Mustang Dark Horse-Based
          Race Car
        </h1>
        <h2>Iconic Sports Car Set to Compete Globally Starting in 2024</h2>
        <p>
          Ford Mustang officially joins the FIA GT3 category with the
          introduction of the new Mustang Dark Horse-based race car. The highly
          anticipated Mustang GT3 is scheduled to compete on a global scale,
          making its debut in 2024.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Mustang GT3 showcases an exciting and daring race livery, designed
          by renowned motorsports designer Troy Lee. This collaboration with Lee
          marks his first venture into the world of Ford race cars.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ford Performance is proud to continue its longstanding partnerships
          with Multimatic and M-Sport, who will play key roles in the production
          of the Mustang GT3 and its powerful Coyote-based V8 engine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Proton Competition has become the first customer team to express their
          intent to enter the 2024 World Endurance Championship season and the
          prestigious 24 Hours of Le Mans with the Ford Mustang.
        </p>
        <h2>Ford Mustang GT3 Takes on the Challenge of 24 Hours of Le Mans</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most iconic sports cars in history, the Ford Mustang GT3,
          is set to compete in the legendary endurance race, the 24 Hours of Le
          Mans, in June 2024.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the centenary celebration on the eve of the 24 Hours of Le
          Mans, the all-new 2024 Mustang Dark Horse served as the platform for
          the unveiling of the Mustang GT3 race car. Troy Lee's vibrant and
          eye-catching design perfectly captures the spirit of this legendary
          vehicle.
        </p>
        <p>
          By entering the global FIA GT3 category, Ford continues its storied
          legacy at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, following its triumph in 2016 with
          the Ford GT.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Ford and Le Mans are bound together by history. And now we’re coming
          back to the most dramatic, most rewarding and most important race in
          the world”, said Jim Farley, CEO of Ford Motor Company. “It is not
          Ford versus Ferrari anymore. It is Ford versus everyone. Going back to
          Le Mans is the beginning of building a global motorsports business
          with Mustang, just like we are doing with Bronco and Raptor off-road”.
        </p>
        <h2>New Ford Performance Branding Unveiled</h2>
        <p>
          In conjunction with the Mustang GT3 reveal, Ford is also introducing
          its new global Ford Performance branding. This refreshed and
          streamlined identity will be featured on all Ford racing vehicles,
          showcasing the brand as a standout lifestyle choice with a competitive
          spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          The updated Ford Performance mark is designed for seamless integration
          across various platforms, including car liveries, merchandise, display
          assets, parts, accessories, and advertising.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://performance.ford.com/" rel="nofollow">Ford Performance</a> has extended its partnership with Multimatic and
          M-Sport, leveraging their expertise to bring the Mustang GT3 project
          to life. Multimatic, known for their work on the iconic Ford GT, will
          assist in building and supporting the Mustang GT3s. M-Sport, a
          two-time World Rally Championship-winning team, will assemble the
          powerful 5.4-liter Coyote-based V8 engines developed by Ford
          Performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          “For a project like the Mustang GT3, we turned to two of our most
          trusted partners in the motorsports world to help bring this vehicle
          and program together” said Mark Rushbrook, Global Director of Ford
          Performance Motorsports. “I know we’ll all be as thrilled as Ford fans
          when Mustang begins racing at the highest levels of GT racing in
          2024”.
        </p>
        <h2>A Look at the Mustang GT3</h2>
        <p>
          The Mustang GT3 race car features a bespoke short-long arm suspension,
          rear-mounted transaxle gearbox, carbon fiber body panels, and a unique
          aerodynamic package developed specifically to meet GT3 standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prior to its debut at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 2024, the Mustang GT3
          will participate in various GT3 series around the world, driven by
          customer teams.
        </p>
        <p>
          Proton Competition, based in Ehingen, Germany, has been announced as
          the first customer team to campaign a pair of Mustang GT3s in the FIA
          World Endurance Championship, starting in 2024.
