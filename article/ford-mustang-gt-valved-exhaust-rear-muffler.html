          Valved Exhaust Rear Muffler can give your car the aggressive sound and
          look that it needs. Designed to fit the 5.0L Mustang, this valved
          axle-back exhaust system will bring your car to life with its

        <h2>The Benefits of the Valved Exhaust Rear Muffler</h2>
        <p>
          The Ford Mustang GT Valved Exhaust Rear Muffler is perfect for Mustang
          owners who want their car to be loud and raspy, but without the drone
          that often comes with other aftermarket exhaust systems. This system
          features a valved design that allows you to adjust the volume and tone
          of your exhaust with the push of a button. This means you can enjoy a
          loud and aggressive sound when you want it, but switch to a quieter
          mode when you need to be more discreet. Additionally, this system
          provides minimal drone on long drives, making it an ideal choice for
          daily drivers.

        <p>

          exhaust system will continue to look and perform its best for years to
