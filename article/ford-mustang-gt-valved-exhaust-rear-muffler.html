        <p>
          The Ford Mustang GT Valved Exhaust Rear Muffler is a dream come true
          for Mustang owners who crave a loud and raspy exhaust note without the
          annoying drone often associated with aftermarket exhaust systems. This
          ingenious system features a valved design that allows you to adjust
          the volume and tone of your exhaust with a simple push of a button.
          This means you can enjoy a thunderous and aggressive sound when you
          desire it, but switch to a quieter mode when you need to be more
          discreet. Moreover, this system provides minimal drone during long
          drives, making it a perfect choice for daily driving and long road
          trips.
        </p>

        <h2>The Sound Profile</h2>

          Muffler does not disappoint. It delivers an aggressive and deep sound
          that is sure to turn heads wherever you go. The high-quality muffler

          the stock exhaust, ensuring a quick and straightforward installation
