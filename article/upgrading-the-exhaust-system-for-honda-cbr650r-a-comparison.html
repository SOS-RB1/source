          levels within acceptable limits while delivering top-notch
          performance, as demanded by the inline-four engine. The weight
          reduction is impressive, shedding over 9 pounds. Furthermore, it
          maintains the legendary Yoshimura quality and sound.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, when it comes to upgrading the exhaust system for your
          Honda CBR650R, you have several exceptional choices. Whether you opt
          for the Akrapovič Racing Line or the Yoshimura Carbon Fiber Muffler,
