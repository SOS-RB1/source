          exhaust system. In this article, we'll take a closer look at the

        <p>
          The ValvedExhausts catback system has vacuum actuated valves that

        <h3>Fully Clamp-On Exhaust (No Welding Needed)</h3>
        <p>
          The catback system is fully clamp-on, which means you don't need to
          weld it onto your car. This makes installation easier and quicker.

        <h3>100% Reversible</h3>
        <p>
