        <h2>Features of the ValvedExhausts Catback System</h2>
        <p>
          The ValvedExhausts catback system for the Toyota Supra A90/A91 comes
          with several features that make it an excellent choice for car
          enthusiasts. Some of these features include:
        </p>
        <h3>Vacuum Actuated Valves</h3>
        <p>
          The ValvedExhausts catback system has vacuum actuated valves that
          allow you to control the sound of your car with a remote. This means
          you can switch between a quiet mode for daily driving and a loud mode
          for track days or when you want to show off.
        </p>
        <h3>3 Inch Pipe Diameter</h3>
        <p>
          The catback system has a 3-inch pipe diameter, which allows for better
          exhaust flow and improved performance. With the larger pipe diameter,
          the exhaust gases can exit the engine more efficiently, resulting in
          reduced backpressure and increased horsepower.
        </p>
        <h3>Lighter than the OEM exhaust</h3>
        <p>
          The ValvedExhausts catback system is also lighter than the OEM
          exhaust, which can help improve your car's handling and overall
          performance. By reducing the weight at the rear of the vehicle, you
          can experience improved cornering and better weight distribution,
          making your Toyota Supra feel more agile on the road or track.
        </p>
        <h3>Fully Clamp-On Exhaust (No Welding Needed)</h3>
        <p>
          The catback system is fully clamp-on, which means you don't need to
          weld it onto your car. This makes installation easier and quicker.
          Additionally, the clamp-on design ensures that you can easily remove
          the exhaust system if needed without causing any damage to your
          vehicle.
        </p>
        <h3>100% Reversible</h3>
        <p>
          The ValvedExhausts catback system is 100% reversible, which means you
          can always go back to the stock exhaust at any time. Whether you plan
          to sell your Toyota Supra or want to switch to a different aftermarket
          exhaust in the future, having the option to revert to the stock setup
          is a significant advantage.
        </p>
        <h3>Minimal Drone Experience</h3>
        <p>
          The catback system also offers a minimal drone experience, which means
          you won't experience excessive noise or vibration in the cabin. Drone,
          a low-frequency noise produced by exhaust systems at certain RPM
          ranges, can be a nuisance during long drives. With the ValvedExhausts
          catback system, you can enjoy a pleasant and comfortable driving
          experience without the annoyance of excessive drone noise.
        </p>
        <h2>Kit Includes</h2>
        <p>
          When you purchase the ValvedExhausts catback system, you'll receive
          the following:

        <h2>Exhaust Finish and Tip Style Options</h2>
        <p>
          The ValvedExhausts catback system for the Toyota Supra A90/A91 comes
          in two finishes: Stainless steel and Titanium. Both finishes offer
          excellent corrosion resistance and durability, ensuring that your
          exhaust system will last for a long time even under harsh driving
          conditions. Additionally, you can choose between a resonated or
          non-resonated front pipe, allowing you to tailor the exhaust sound to
          your preference.
        </p>
        <p>
          The catback system also comes with a variety of tip styles, including
          stainless steel, burnt, gloss black, carbon fiber, and forged carbon.
          These different tip options not only add a distinct visual appeal to
          your Toyota Supra but also allow you to customize the look of your
          exhaust system to match your car's overall style and personality.
