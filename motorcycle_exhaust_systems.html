              <h2>The Importance of Exhaust Systems for Two-Stroke Motorcycles</h2>
              <p>Two-stroke engines are commonly found in motorcycles, particularly in off-road and racing models. These engines work differently than four-stroke engines, as they use a different combustion cycle to generate power. Because of this, two-stroke engines require a specific type of exhaust system to operate efficiently and effectively.</p>

              <h2>What are the types of exhaust systems for motorcycles?</h2>
              <p>There are different types of exhaust systems available for motorcycles, each with its own unique features and advantages"</p>

              <h2>APRILIA TUONO 660 & RS660 2021-2022: BOX DELETE & FULL EXHAUST SYSTEMS</h2>
              <p>The V3 Mini is available in two sizes: 140mm and 200mm, and comes in either Black Ceramic or Titanium. The silencer is constructed entirely from titanium, and boasts advanced flow dynamics for optimal performance. It also offers significant weight savings, although the exact figure is yet to be announced.

                The 200mm length silencer is db compliant, while the box delete option requires cutting of your stock headers to ensure proper fitment. Full instructions are provided with the product.

                If you opt to add headers to your purchase, this will create a full system and eliminate the need for cutting. However, please note that choosing the ceramic coating option will add one additional week to the production lead time.

                DB levels have been tested at 5000 RPM, with the following results: Stock – 92-93db, V3 Mini 140mm – 101-102db, and V3 Mini 200mm – 95-96db (db compliant).</p>
