              <h2>VR Performance Audi R8 2020+ Blue Titanium Exhaust System</h2>
              <p>Although the Audi R8 boasts an impressive engine note, VR Performance has taken it to the next level with their titanium Valvetronic exhaust system, which accentuates the V10's sound. By widening the piping diameter to 3 inches (76mm), backpressure is reduced, leading to more efficient exhaust flow. The exhaust note is slightly louder than the factory setting when the valves are closed, but once they are opened, the muffler is bypassed, allowing the V10 to breathe freely and produce an even more exhilarating sound.</p>
